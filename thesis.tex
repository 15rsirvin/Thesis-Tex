	Welcome to the \LaTeX\ thesis template. If you've never used \TeX\ or \LaTeX\ before, you'll have an initial learning period to go through, but the results of a nicely formatted thesis are worth it for more than the aesthetic benefit: markup like \LaTeX\ is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities. If you're still on the fence about  using \LaTeX, read the Introduction to LaTeX on the CUS site as well as skim the following template and give it a few weeks. Pretty soon all the markup gibberish will become second nature.

\section{Why use it?}
	
\LaTeX\ does a great job of formatting tables and paragraphs. Its line-breaking algorithm was the subject of a PhD.\thinspace thesis. It does a fine job of automatically inserting ligatures, and to top it all off it is the only way to typeset good-looking mathematics.

\section{Who should use it?}

Anyone who needs to use math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, IPA or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use \LaTeX. At Reed, math majors are required to use it, most physics majors will want to use it, and many other science majors may want it also.
	
    \chapter{Agent Systems}
    	This chapter lays out the background material of multi-agent systems--what they are, how they work, and why economists might be interested in them--that drives the rest of the thesis. 
	
\section{Agents}
An \textbf{agent} is something that acts. This comes from the Latin word agere, to do. In general, anything might be considered an agent so long as it can perceive the environment and act upon it. A \textbf{rational agents} is something that acts to achieve the best outcome or with uncertainty, the best expected outcome in a given situation. For example we are agents, we have the ability to take an action and effect the world. We even might be considered rational since we are generally trying to navigate the world around us so as to try and lead to our preferred outcome. People are not the only agents, animals and machines are also agents capable of acting on the world around them. 

\subsection{In Economics}
In economics many of the models are constructed with utility maximizing agents in line with Decision Theory and Rational Choice Theory. Because economics seeks to understand the outcomes of peoples interactions, and perhaps how these outcomes could be improved, if people can be modeled as utility maximizers, it is then possible to analytically solve for this solution and see what the results are. 

The primary purpose of constructing agents in economics is to see how their interactions play out in an economic setting that can not be solved analytically.  
 
\subsection{In Artificial Intelligence}\label{commands}
In artificial intelligence, the primary purpose of understanding agents is to try and create the most effective artificial agents possible. This discipline cares deeply about how good the agents they are able to make are able to solve problems, either general or specific. To do this, they use much of the theory of agents with a deep emphasis on how a constructed agent can be taught or learn from its environment to achieve its goals.


	
\section{Formal Model of Agents}
This section lays out a more formal definition of agents, specifically geared towards constructed or artificial agents such as we will be constructing. An \textbf{agent} is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon its environment through actuators. A \textbf{precept} is a perceptual input to an agent, and a \textbf{precept sequence} is the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived. The agent then has an \textbf{agent function} that maps these precepts to an action. In the case of an artificial agent this is done with an \textbf{agent program} that is the physical implementation of the agent function. In the case of an agent simulated on a computer, this will be the computer code that decides what action to take. The agents actions will then cause the environment to go through a series of states and the agent will measure the outcome with some \textbf{performance measure}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	% the options are h = here, t = top, b = bottom, p = page of figures.
	% you can add an exclamation mark to make it try harder, and multiple
	% options if you have an order of preference, e.g.
	% \begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	
	\centering
	% DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	\includegraphics[scale=0.05, angle=90]{utilityAgent}
	\caption{Utility Based Agent}
	\label{utility-agent-STOLEN}
\end{figure}

For our purposes we focus on what are called \textbf{utility based agents}, where the agent has a utility function as an internalized performance measure and is able to numerically assign values of "goodness" to the outcome from the agents perspective. A rational agent will always try to maximize average expected utility over its lifetime as explained by decision theory.

\subsection{Task Environment}
The environment that an agent exists in and their relationship to it is critical for understanding the system as a whole. For example the environment can fully observable with the agent's sensors able to see the entire environment, or only partially observable to the agent. There can also be multiple agents within the system, each trying to maximize their own performance measure. This is called a \textbf{multi-agent system} and it will be a key aspect of all of the simulations we construct. It is important to note that the agents in the multi-agent system share no internal state and must communicate (if they so wish to do so) through the environment. The environment can also be deterministic or stochastic, either depending entirely upon its current state and the agents actions or contains randomness.
	
\subsection{Agents Who Learn}

Learning is a critical part of being a rational agent. We expect that as agents interact with their environment, they should be able to adapt and change in order to continue to maximize their utility. The general model of an artificial agent who learns is as follows. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.05]{learningAgent}
	\caption{Model of Agent that Learns}
	\label{learning-agent-STOLEN}
\end{figure}

First, the agent reprieves its environment and sends that information to the performance function that determines what it will do. There is now a critic that gives feedback for how the agent is doing based on aprori information and the observed state that sends feedback to a learning element that can change the behavior of the performance element. Based on what the learning element is trying improve, there is also a problem generator that suggests actions to the performance element so that different actions can be tested and evaluated.  

\chapter{Reinforcement Learning}	

Reinforcement learning has become a popular way of teaching agents how to play games and interact with each other in Machine Learning (ML). Because the dynamics and behavior of a final simulation are determined by the learning algorithm used for its composing agents, we spend some time developing the ideas of reinforcement learning in both a single agent and multi-agent setting. 
\section{Single Agent Learning}
	Reinforcement learning is the area of machine learning where agents learn through repeated interactions with their dynamic environment. This section gives a brief overview of learning algorithms used by single agents with a focus on deep reinforcement learning. In general, reiforcment learning formalizes the interaction of agents and environment using a Markov decision process (MDP).\\
	
	\textbf{Definition:} Markov Decision Process \\
	A Markov decision process is 5-tuple $ \langle \mathcal{S, A,} R, T, \gamma \rangle $ where, \\
	\textbf{1.} $\mathcal{S}$ represents a finite set of states \\
	\textbf{2.} $\mathcal{A}$ represents a finite set of actions \\
	\textbf{3.} $T$ is a transition function $T: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow [0,1]$ that determines the probability of transitioning from any state $s \in \mathcal{S}$ to any state $s^{'} \in \mathcal{S}$ given any possible action $a \in A$\\
	\textbf{4.} $R$ is the reward function $R: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$\\
	\textbf{5.} $\gamma \in [0,1]$ is the discount factor that balances immediate and future rewards
	
	
\subsection{Q-Learning}
Q-Learning is an an algorithm that has been developed for single-agent, fully observable environments with discrete actions. Q learning involves creating a table of expected payoffs for each action $a$ available at a state $s$ denoted $\hat{Q}(s,a)$. Each time the agent transitions from a state $s$ to a state $s^{'}$ taking an action $a$ and recieving payoff $r$, the $Q$ table is updated according to the following assignment:
$$ \hat{Q}(s,a) \leftarrow \hat{Q}(s,a) + \alpha [(r + \gamma max_{a^{1}} \hat{Q}(s^{'}, a^{'})) - \hat{Q}(s,a)] $$

where we pick $\alpha \in [0,1]$ which we call the learning rate.

\subsection{Deep Reinforcement Learning}
Using deep learning in the form of Neural Networks can be helpful for exploring large policy spaces efficiently. It also eliminates the need to hand design features to be optimized for the reinforcement learning process.

\chapter{Tables and Graphics}

\section{Tables}
	The following section contains examples of tables, most of which have been commented out for brevity. (They will show up in the .tex document in red, but not at all in the .pdf). For more help in constructing a table (or anything else in this document), please see the LaTeX pages on the CUS site. 

\begin{table}[htbp] % begins the table floating environment. This enables LaTeX to fit the table where it works best and lets you add a caption.
\caption[Correlation of Inheritance Factors between Parents and Child]{Correlation of Inheritance Factors between Parents and Child} 
% The words in square brackets of the caption command end up in the Table of Tables. The words in curly braces are the caption directly over the table.
\begin{center} 
% makes the table centered
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} 
% the tabular environment is used to make the table itself. The {c c c c} specify that the table will have four columns and they will all be center-aligned. You can make the cell contents left aligned by replacing the Cs with Ls or right aligned by using Rs instead. Add more letters for more columns, and pipes (the vertical line above the backslash) for vertical lines. Another useful type of column is the p{width} column, which forces text to wrap within whatever width you specify e.g. p{1in}. Text will wrap badly in narrow columns though, so beware.
\toprule % a horizontal line, slightly thicker than \hline, depends on the booktabs package
  Factors &  Correlation between Parents \& Child & Inherited \\ % the first row of the table. Separate columns with ampersands and end the line with two backslashes. An environment begun in one cell will not carry over to adjacent rows.
  \midrule % another horizontal line
	Education 				& -0.49 & Yes 	 \\ % another row
	Socio-Economic Status 	& 0.28 	& Slight \\
	Income 					& 0.08 	& No	 \\
	Family Size 			& 0.19 	& Slight \\
	Occupational Prestige 	& 0.21 	& Slight \\
\bottomrule % yet another horizontal line
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{inheritance} % labels are useful when you have more than one table or figure in your document. See our online documentation for more on this.
\end{table}

   \section{Figures}
   
	If your thesis has a lot of figures, \LaTeX\ might behave better for you than that other word processor.  One thing that may be annoying is the way it handles ``floats'' like tables and figures. \LaTeX\ will try to find the best place to put your object based on the text around it and until you're really, truly done writing you should just leave it where it lies.   There are some optional arguments to the figure and table environments to specify where you want it to appear; see the comments in the first figure.

	If you need a graphic or tabular material to be part of the text, you can just put it inline. If you need it to appear in the list of figures or tables, it should be placed in the floating environment. 
	
	To get a figure from StatView, JMP, SPSS or other statistics program into a figure, you can print to pdf or save the image as a jpg or png. Precisely how you will do this depends on the program: you may need to copy-paste figures into Photoshop or other graphic program, then save in the appropriate format.
	
	Below we have put a few examples of figures. For more help using graphics and the float environment, see our online documentation.
	
	And this is how you add a figure with a graphic:
	\begin{figure}[h]
	% the options are h = here, t = top, b = bottom, p = page of figures.
	% you can add an exclamation mark to make it try harder, and multiple
	% options if you have an order of preference, e.g.
	% \begin{figure}[h!tbp]
	   
	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	    \includegraphics{subdivision}
	     \caption{A Figure}
	 \label{subd}
	\end{figure}

\clearpage %% starts a new page and stops trying to place floats such as tables and figures

\section{More Figure Stuff}
You can also scale and rotate figures.
 	\begin{figure}[h!]
	   
	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	    \includegraphics[scale=0.5,angle=180]{subdivision}
	    % if your figure shows up not where you want it, it may just be too big to fit. You can use the scale argument to shrink it, e.g. scale=0.85 is 85 percent of the original size. 
	     \caption{A Smaller Figure, Flipped Upside Down}
	 \label{subd2}
	\end{figure}

\section{Even More Figure Stuff}
With some clever work you can crop a figure, which is handy if (for instance) your EPS or PDF is a little graphic on a whole sheet of paper. The viewport arguments are the lower-left and upper-right coordinates for the area you want to crop.

 	\begin{figure}[h!]
	    	       \centering
	    % DO NOT ADD A FILENAME EXTENSION TO THE GRAPHIC FILE
	   \includegraphics[clip=true, viewport=.0in .0in 1in 1in]{subdivision}
	    \caption{A Cropped Figure}
	 \label{subd3}
	\end{figure}
	
      \subsection{Common Modifications}

\chapter*{Conclusion}

	\setcounter{chapter}{4}
	\setcounter{section}{0}
	
Here's a conclusion, demonstrating the use of all that manual incrementing and table of contents adding that has to happen if you use the starred form of the chapter command. The deal is, the chapter command in \LaTeX\ does a lot of things: it increments the chapter counter, it resets the section counter to zero, it puts the name of the chapter into the table of contents and the running headers, and probably some other stuff. 

So, if you remove all that stuff because you don't like it to say ``Chapter 4: Conclusion'', then you have to manually add all the things \LaTeX\ would normally do for you. Maybe someday we'll write a new chapter macro that doesn't add ``Chapter X'' to the beginning of every chapter title.

\section{More info}
And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there. 


%If you feel it necessary to include an appendix, it goes here.
    \appendix
      \chapter{The First Appendix}
      \chapter{The Second Appendix, for Fun}


%This is where endnotes are supposed to go, if you have them.
%I have no idea how endnotes work with LaTeX.

  \backmatter % backmatter makes the index and bibliography appear properly in the t.o.c...

% if you're using bibtex, the next line forces every entry in the bibtex file to be included
% in your bibliography, regardless of whether or not you've cited it in the thesis.
    \nocite{*}

% Rename my bibliography to be called "Works Cited" and not "References" or ``Bibliography''
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{Works Cited}

%    \bibliographystyle{bsts/mla-good} % there are a variety of styles available; 
%  \bibliographystyle{plainnat}
% replace ``plainnat'' with the style of choice. You can refer to files in the bsts or APA 
% subfolder, e.g. 
 \bibliographystyle{APA/apa-good}  % or
 \bibliography{thesis}
 % Comment the above two lines and uncomment the next line to use biblatex-chicago.
 %\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]

% Finally, an index would go here... but it is also optional.
