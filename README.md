 #Senior Thesis Tex: Simulating the Price of Anarchy

This is my senior thesis for Reed College for Mathematics-Economics. The thesis is a simulation of first-price, single-item auctions to demonstrate the price of anarchy bounds for no-regret learners demonstrated by Roughgarden et al. 2017. 

The code for the simulations can be found [here]{https://github.com/15rsirvin/Computational-Economics}
